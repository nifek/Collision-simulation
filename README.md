# Collision-simulation
A simulation of a ball flying in a box and colliding with its walls until either the velocity becomes or the ball hits the target 
The ball gets random direction and coordinates, also has the initial speed of 100. It gradually slows down and eventually stops. The trajectory of the ball is shown, as well as the ball itself and the target. At the end outputs the final trajectory of the ball. Is designed to be run in some IDE.
